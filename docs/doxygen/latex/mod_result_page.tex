\hypertarget{mod_result_page_result_overview}{}\section{Overview}\label{mod_result_page_result_overview}
Data\+Result\+Viewer modules exist in the upper-\/right area of the default Autopsy interface, as shown below.



They display a set of files that are passed into the viewer from the tree on the left, keyword searching, or other searches. The main idea is that the same set of files can be viewed in table form, thumbnail form, or any other form that you can think of. Once a file is selected from the Data\+Result area, it is passed to the Data\+Content area for display.\hypertarget{mod_result_page_result_dataflow}{}\section{Data Flow}\label{mod_result_page_result_dataflow}
This section provides some basics on Data\+Result viewers. Data\+Result viewers are created as needed. The directory tree on the left creates one when it loads and uses it for the life of the application. The keyword search module creates on each time it performs a keyword search. Data is explicitly passed into it.

By default, when a node is selected, it is then passed to the default Data\+Content viewer (this is done in org.\+sleuthkit.\+autopsy.\+corecomponents.\+Abstract\+Data\+Result\+Viewer). There can be many data content viewers, but only one default one exists.

The org.\+sleuthkit.\+autopsy.\+corecomponents.\+Data\+Result\+Viewer\+Top\+Component class is the Net\+Beans Top\+Component that encapsulates the various Data\+Result viewer modules. It creates tabs for each Data\+Result viewer module.\hypertarget{mod_result_page_result_nb}{}\section{Net\+Beans Module Configuration}\label{mod_result_page_result_nb}
The rest of the document assumes that you have already created your Net\+Beans module, as outlined in \hyperlink{mod_dev_page_mod_dev_module}{Creating a Basic Net\+Beans Module}.

Data\+Result\+Viewer modules will have additional Net\+Beans dependencies. Right click on the module, choose \char`\"{}\+Properties\char`\"{} -\/$>$ \char`\"{}\+Libraries\char`\"{} -\/$>$ \char`\"{}\+Module Dependencies\char`\"{}. Add \char`\"{}\+Lookup A\+P\+I\char`\"{} and \char`\"{}\+Nodes A\+P\+I\char`\"{}.\hypertarget{mod_result_page_result_mod}{}\section{Module Development}\label{mod_result_page_result_mod}
You will need a class that extends org.\+sleuthkit.\+autopsy.\+corecomponents.\+Abstract\+Data\+Result\+Viewer. You can use Net\+Beans to make a class, manually extend it, and then let Net\+Beans complain about missing methods. It will provide default implementations for them if you click on the error messages in the UI. Refer to the documentation in org.\+sleuthkit.\+autopsy.\+corecomponentinterfaces.\+Data\+Result\+Viewer on what each method should do. Note that Abstract\+Data\+Result\+Viewer extends J\+Panel.

Autopsy will find your module using the Net\+Beans Lookup infrastructure. To be found, you will need to register as a service provider for Data\+Result\+Viewer.\+class by annotating your class as follows\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}
@ServiceProvider(service = DataResultViewer.class)
public class DataResultViewerTable extends AbstractDataResultViewer \{
\end{DoxyCode}


If you get errors about not knowing about Service\+Providers and such, ensure that you configured your Net\+Beans module to depend on the Nodes and Lookup A\+P\+Is as outlined in the previous section.

The current modules in this viewer area heavily use the Net\+Beans Explorer\+Manger and Node concepts. You do not need to use Explorer\+Manager concepts, but you will need to use Node concepts to identify the set of nodes to display and to extract the datamodel objects from each Node object. Refer to \hyperlink{mod_content_page_content_hints_objects}{Getting Content} for hints on getting the datamodel objects from the Node.\hypertarget{mod_result_page_result_examples}{}\section{Example Modules}\label{mod_result_page_result_examples}
You can refer to the org.\+sleuthkit.\+autopsy.\+corecomponents.\+Data\+Result\+Viewer\+Table and org.\+sleuthkit.\+autopsy.\+corecomponents.\+Data\+Result\+Viewer\+Thumbnail modules to follow as examples.\hypertarget{mod_result_page_result_hint}{}\section{Hints}\label{mod_result_page_result_hint}
Note that we have made the least number of these types of modules, so some work could be done to make the framework and infrastuture for them better.

These modules are currently the most challenging to develop because they require the most Net\+Beans knowledge about Nodes and Explorer\+Managers. Make sure you read some of the tutorials (or books) first\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Net\+Beans Nodes A\+PI Tutorial (\href{https://platform.netbeans.org/tutorials/nbm-nodesapi2.html}{\tt https\+://platform.\+netbeans.\+org/tutorials/nbm-\/nodesapi2.\+html})
\item Net\+Beans Nodes, Explorer Manager, and Component Palette Tutorial (\href{https://platform.netbeans.org/tutorials/nbm-nodesapi3.html}{\tt https\+://platform.\+netbeans.\+org/tutorials/nbm-\/nodesapi3.\+html})
\end{DoxyItemize}

We have plans to change the design a bit in the future so that an Explorer\+Manager is created for each Data\+Result\+Viewer\+Top\+Component instance and each individual module does not need to make one. Instead, one will be given to it.
